# Overview

Every person or organization has multiple accounts over various web platforms like Gmail, MongoDB, Facebook or even their wifi password. Remembering all the passwords across different platforms can be a problem especially when it comes to organizations as they need to share passwords among team members. The intended password manager system would allow team members to store and share credentials securely. For instance, the wifi password of your office, the administrator password of a router, or your organization's social media account password. It leverages encryption and decryption algorithms to encrypt and decrypt the secrets using public and private keys. This system would be implemented using a website to manage the passwords and a Chrome extension to store the private key on the browser and interact with the website to do the decryption.


# Project Context and Scope

The project was introducted to us by Novobi, a Software Company in Texas but the reason why we chose to work on this project was that whenever we used to enter credentials to any website, google chrome used to ask us "Do you want to save your credentials?" and once you save your credentials you can direclty just click on the password section and the password was autofilled by the chrome. We often wondered if we could work on building something like this and that when we though of building this project.

So far the project is in its initial pre-development stage Sprint 0 and the requirements for the project are yet to be discussed with the client. Within the next few weeks we will be working on a prototype for this after discussing with the client.



# System Analysis

A rough design of the website that we planned to build will include a portal that will allow the user to add a chrome extension on the user browser which will generate and store the private key.


## High-level Requirements

A prototype of the website that would show some basic functionality like managing registeration, a database to store user data.


# Impacts

So far we have planned to use MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) to develop this project but after a final plan and clear use cases, we will be able to understand its impacts.


# Software Process Management


We have used AGILE methodology to divide the project into 5 sprints. Currently we are in the Pre-Development Stage sprint 0.

The Trello would have a weekly task and they would be updated everytime a task is completed. 


## Scrum process

### Sprint 0

Duration: 01/09/2023 - 01/20/2023

#### Completed Tasks:  

1. Project Plan
2. Initial draft of the report
